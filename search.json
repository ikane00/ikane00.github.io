    "text": "Does serving affect your ability to be a great tennis player?\nIvo Karlovic has the best serving percentage with 92% on all surfaces including clay, hard, and grass. His career service games won is 8,845, though Karlovic is no longer an active player.\nKarlovic isn’t in the top 50 list of Wins and Losses, which can tell us that even if you are a really good and consistent server, it doesn’t necessarily make you a great tennis player.\nThe other great servers here are John Isner, Milos Raonic, Andy Roddick, Roger Federer, Pete Sampras, Nick Kyrgios, Wayne Arthurs, Matteo Berrettini, and Richard Krajicek.\nThe top 10 servers fall between 75%-92% in serving percentages. Counting just active players, John Isner would be the best server with a 91% serving percentage.\nRoddick, Federer, Sampras, Arthurs, and Krajicek are the other inactive players on this list, leaving four active players as the best servers of all time.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nserves &lt;- read_csv(\"Tennis Serves - Sheet1 (2).csv\")\n\nplayers &lt;- serves |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    `Games Won` = Percentage/ `Total Games`\n  )\n\nik &lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Ivo Karlovic\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=players, aes(x=reorder(Player, Percentage), weight=Percentage), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=ik, aes(x=reorder(Player, Percentage), weight=Percentage), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Serving Percentage\", \n    title=\"Best Servers on the ATP Tour\", \n    subtitle=\"Serving Percentages Among Top Male Singles Players\", \n    caption=\"Source: ATP Tour | Isabella Kane\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfault &lt;- read_csv(\"Faults - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nnd &lt;- fault |&gt; filter(Player == \"Novak Djokovic\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=fault, aes(x=`Avg.

The outlier dot at 7.5 faults a match is Alexander Bublik. Having double faults doesn’t necessarily make you a bad tennis player, Bublik has the highest average double faults but ranks in the top 50.\nIt’s very rare to not have a double fault once in a match, especially if the match has gone on for awhile making the players more tired and it harder to serve.\n\n\nCode\nwins &lt;- read_csv(\"Win Loss Index - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nscore &lt;- wins |&gt; separate(`YTD Win/Loss`, into=c(\"Win\", \"Loss\"), sep=\"-\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=score, \n    aes(y=Player, x=Win, xend=Loss),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n    labs(\n    title=\"Wins and Losses on the ATP Tour\", \n    subtitle = \"Wins are green, Losses are red.\", caption=\"Source: ATP Tour | Bella Kane\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top player in terms of wins and losses this year is Carlos Alvarez, who actually ended up winning Wimbledon 2023 in men’s singles. He won 63 matches and lost only nine.\nFollowing him is Novak Djokovic, who Alvarez played in the Wimbledon’s final match. He won 46 matches and lost five.\nBeing a good server can make you a great player in the case of Djokovic, but there are many other factors that come into play on the court that can contribute to being a great player. The average wins for these singles players is around 37 and the average losses is usually around 22, except for the outlier Djokovic and Alvarez.\nServing doesn’t necessarily make you a good player but it can certainly help to make you a great tennis player."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As someone from Illinois, people expect me to be fan of the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign football team but I was never really into college football until I got to college. I’m interested in finding out if Illinois was a good football team in 2022.\nI did a beeswarm chart to figure out if Illinois had any players that ranked among the top 200 last year in yards. Only one player, Chase Brown, made the list. This doesn’t necessarily make Illinois a bad team but it leads to them being a more average team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"players.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nactiveplayers &lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(Yds &gt; 450)\n\nil &lt;- players |&gt; \n  filter(School == \"Illinois\")\n\nplayers &lt;- activeplayers |&gt; mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=players,\n    aes(x=Conf, y=Yds), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=il,\n    aes(x=Conf, y=Yds), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=il,\n    aes(x=Conf, y=Yds, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Yards Per Player\", \n    title=\"Does Illinois have any players that are ranked among the top 200 in 2022?\", \n    subtitle=\"Only one player from Illinois, Chase Brown\", \n    caption=\"Source: SRCFB | Bella Kane\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up I wanted to figure out where Illinois ranked among the big ten in 2022. Illinois ranks somewhere among the lower middle of the Big Ten with 8 wins last year, which was around average.\nOnly three teams had more than 10 wins inclulding Michigan, Penn State, and Ohio State. Minnesota has nine wins. Purdue, Maryland, Iowa, and Illinois all have eight wins. Below eight wins is Wisconsin at seven wins and Michigan State at five wins. Then we have Rutgers, Nebraska, and Indiana at four wins. Lastly, Northwestern with two wins. As Illinois is in the middle, this all points to them being an average team in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nbigten &lt;- read_csv(\"bigten.csv\")\n\nil &lt;- bigten |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Illinois\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=bigten, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=il, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W), fill=\"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n    title=\"Where does Illinois rank among the Big Ten in 2022\", \n    subtitle=\"Illinois placed somewhere in the middle among the Big Ten\", \n    caption=\"Source: SRCFB | Isabella Kane\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to do a stacked bar chart to compare offensive rushing and passing yards among the Big Ten football teams. Purdue leads the Big Ten in total yards with 1,990 rushing yards and 3,903 passing yards, almost at a total of 6,000 yards. Ohio State follows with 3,878 passing yards and 1,574 rushing yards. Maryland is next with 3,378 passing yards and 1,739 rushing yards. Next is Michigan State with 2,143 rushing yards and 2,880 passing yards. Next is Nebraska with 2,269 rushing yards and 2,650 passing yards.\nNorthwestern is next with 2,269 rushing yards and 2,524 passing yards. Next is Penn State with 1,446 rushing yards and 3,328 passing yards. Indiana is next and they have 2,101 rushing yards and 2,609 passing yards. Next is Michigan with 1,371 rushing yards and 3,078 passing yards.\nNext is Illinois, pretty low on this list with only four other teams lower than them and nine teams are ahead of Illinois. Illinois has 1,297 rushing yards and 2,735 passing yards. Below Illinois is Minnesota with 1,417 rushing yards and 2,369 passing yards. Wisconsin with 2,390 passing yards and 1,280 rushing yards. Second to last is Rutgers with 1,715 rushing yards and 1,847 passing yards.\nAnd the team with the lowest total yards is Iowa with 1,317 rushing yards and 2,307 passing yards. Illinois is among the lower part of total yards, making the team more average than others. Though I’ve only shown three charts of data that point towards Illinois being an average team, there other areas I didn’t measure where Illinois is good or worse at.\n\n\nCode\nrushing &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing - Sheet1.csv\")\npassing &lt;- read_csv(\"passing - Sheet1.csv\")\n\n\ncombined &lt;- rushing |&gt; inner_join(passing, by=c(\"Team\" = \"Team\"))\n\nbigwide &lt;- combined |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Yards\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Yards\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=bigwide, aes(x=reorder(Team, Yards), weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Is Illinois an average team?\", \n    subtitle=\"Maybe even worse than average\", \n    caption=\"Source: SRCFB | Isabella Kane\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")"
